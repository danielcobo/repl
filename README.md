- best code is no code
- be descriptive when naming

## 🧪 Testing

**Testing suite:** [🃏 Jest](https://jestjs.io) | **Test command:** `npm test`

**Mutation testing suite:** [👽 Stryker Mutator](https://stryker-mutator.io) | **Mutation test command:** `npm run mutation`

If you intend to develop further or contribute code, then please ensure to write and use testing. Strive for 100% code coverage and high mutation scores. Mutation score 100 is great, but it's not always neccessary (if there are valid reasons).
